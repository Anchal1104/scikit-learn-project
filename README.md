# Scikit-Learn Machine Learning Project

## ðŸ“š Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of machine learning models using *Scikit-Learn (sklearn)*, a popular Python library for machine learning. The goal of this project is to perform data preprocessing, train models, evaluate performance, and make predictions using supervised learning algorithms.

## âš¡ Features
- Data Loading and Preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding categorical features)
- Model Training (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Model Evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix)
- Hyperparameter Tuning (using GridSearchCV)
- Making Predictions on New Data
